In this directory are a set of ERT configuration scripts for running the
ERT on various machines to obtain an empirical roofline measurement:

  config.babbage.nersc.gov.01
    Knight's Corner (KNC) node testing only the host and not the MIC

  config.babbage.nersc.gov.02
    Knight's Corner (KNC) node testing only the MIC and not the host

  config.edison.nersc.gov.01
    Cray XC30 node - 2 x 12-core Intel "Ivy Bridge" processors

  config.madonna.lbl.gov.01
    Linux workstation, MPI and OpenMP (8-core Intel Xeon CPU E5530, 2.40 GHz)

  config.madonna.lbl.gov.02
    Linux workstation, Only OpenMP (8-core Intel Xeon CPU E5530, 2.40 GHz)

  config.mira.alcf.anl.gov.01
    IBM Blue Gene/Q node - 16 1600 MHz PowerPC A2 cores

  config.titan.ccs.ornl.gov.01
    Cray XK7 node - Test only the host processor on the node,
                    16-core 2.2GHz AMD Opteron™ 6274 (Interlagos) processor

  config.titan.ccs.ornl.gov.02
    Cray XK7 node - Test only the GPU processor on the node,
                    NVIDIA Kepler™accelerator GPU

The goal of these configuration files is to obtain a good empirical
roofline measurement.  That said, these are only examples and it may be
possible to obtain better rooflines with different compiler/loader flags,
drivers/kernels, etc.

There are example batch scripts in "../Batch" and results from running these
configuration files on the appropriate machines in "../Results".

We are actively interested in improved results and how they were obtained.
Please contact us with any results/configurations you feel would improve
these examples.
